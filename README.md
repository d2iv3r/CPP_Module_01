# C++ Module: Memory Allocation, Pointers, References, and Switch Statement

## Overview

In this module, we will explore some of the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, focusing on **memory allocation**, **pointers to members**, **references**, and the **switch statement**. These concepts are crucial for writing efficient and effective C++ code. By the end of this module, youâ€™ll have a deeper understanding of memory management, how to handle references and pointers in a program, and the best practices for using control structures like the `switch` statement.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Memory Allocation**
- Introduction to **dynamic memory allocation** in C++.
- Using `new` and `delete` to allocate and deallocate memory.
- Differences between stack and heap memory.
- Handling memory leaks and ensuring proper memory management.

### 2. **Pointers to Members**
- Understanding **pointers to member functions** and **pointers to member variables** in C++.
- How to use pointers to call member functions and access member variables.
- Syntax for defining and using pointers to class members.

### 3. **References**
- **References** in C++ and their role in avoiding unnecessary copies of objects.
- Differences between pointers and references.
- How to use references for passing arguments to functions efficiently.
- **Reference variables** vs **constant references**.

### 4. **Switch Statement**
- The **switch** statement in C++ as a control structure for selecting one out of many options.
- Understanding the syntax and usage of the `switch` statement.
- Benefits and limitations of using `switch` instead of `if-else` chains.
- Using `break`, `case`, and `default` with `switch`.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Eclipse)

## How to Run

1. Install a C++ compiler and text editor/IDE of your choice.
2. Clone this repository or download the module files.
3. Open the project folder in your IDE or text editor.
4. Compile the program using the C++ compiler.

For example, if using GCC, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
